# EDA-using-SweetViz-and-AutoViz
This project uses the SweetViz and AutoViz libraries in Python to create effective visuals and analysis for a Loan Defaulter dataset.

This is a part of AI Engineering's video series on Data Analysis and Machine Learning. I shall be adding more details and working on the EDA of different datasets soon.
